# Discription of the Lab 
* what does this program do:
 
  The required function for this program is the fourier transform : 
  X(n𝚫f) = 𝚫t ∑x(k𝚫t)exp(-j2π n𝚫f k𝚫f) 

  that it will help us with the previous data (vectors, constants),to make a
signal processing in the discrete mode 

   and we used the "for" loop which will help us to
carry out the mechanism until the end of the length of ‘t’
* here is the execution of the code:
